# EagleJammers ðŸ¦…

### What we do
We're a group of students attending Eastern Washington University who meet up to do game jams

### How to join
There are no formal requirements to join. Message Ray Tanner#2916 on Discord if you want an invitation.

### What tools we use
So far we have used the Unity engine and C# for development because it tends to be most familiar for members.
Experience is not required, but a little goes a long way!

### How to play the games 
If you are not a member of EagleJammers, fork and clone the repos and open them up with a compatible version of the Unity hub.
We have been using 2021LTS for development, it is advised you use that to launch the games
Unity will generate it's own engine files and the game should launch, barring any major errors.
